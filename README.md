# Kanban
Personal planner

This is a windows exe, that is purely a text editor with the columns "To do", "Doing", "Waiting", "Done", and "Notes". It allows me to manage my todo list. I wrote this app because at the time I just found out about Kanban, and in the interest of the moment, I thought I wanted to write my own.
